# üìò Learn REST API with NestJS & PostgreSQL

Welcome to this beginner-friendly guide for building a **REST API** using **NestJS** and **PostgreSQL**. This is for students who want to understand backend development step-by-step.

---

## üìå What is an API?

**API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**.  
It allows two software systems to communicate with each other.

Example:  
If you use a food delivery app, the app talks to the server through an API to show your order status.

---

## üìå What is a REST API?

**REST API** (Representational State Transfer) is a type of API that follows certain rules.  
It uses **HTTP methods** like:

- `GET` ‚Üí to fetch data  
- `POST` ‚Üí to send data  
- `PUT/PATCH` ‚Üí to update data  
- `DELETE` ‚Üí to remove data  

---

## ‚úÖ What Can We Do with a REST API?

With a REST API, we can:

- Build websites or mobile apps that talk to a database
- Create login systems
- Fetch product lists, update user profiles, delete items
- And much more...

---

## üß† Extra Knowledge for Students

### ‚úÖ What is Node.js?

**Node.js** is a runtime environment that lets you run JavaScript outside the browser ‚Äî mainly on servers.  
It helps you build **server-side applications**, like APIs or backends.

üß† Think of Node.js as the engine that runs JavaScript on your computer like how a browser does, but without the browser.

---

### ‚úÖ What is npm?

**npm** stands for **Node Package Manager**.  
It helps you **install and manage libraries** (also called packages) in your Node.js projects.

üõ† Example:  
You can run `npm install express` to add the Express.js framework to your project.

---

### ‚úÖ What is a Framework?

A **framework** is a pre-built structure or toolkit for building software faster and in an organized way.  
It gives you **rules, patterns, and ready-made tools** so you don‚Äôt start from scratch every time.

üß± Analogy:  
If programming is building a house, a framework is like a house-building kit with instructions and pre-made parts.

---

### ‚úÖ What is NestJS?

**NestJS** is a **backend framework** built with and for **Node.js**.  
It uses **TypeScript** and helps you build **scalable, modular REST APIs** easily.

üåü Why use NestJS?
- Clean and organized code
- Built-in support for dependency injection
- Uses decorators (like `@Get()`, `@Post()`) like Angular
- Works well with databases like PostgreSQL


---

## üîÑ What is Dependency Injection (DI) in NestJS?

In NestJS, **Dependency Injection (DI)** means you **don‚Äôt create objects manually** inside your class. Instead, **NestJS creates them for you** and gives them to you **when you need them**.

---

### üîß Think of NestJS Like a Factory with a Manager

- When your app starts, **NestJS's DI system acts like a manager**.
- This manager goes through all your modules and **creates one instance of each service, controller, etc.**
- These are stored **in a container (a kind of internal storage)**.

---

### üß† Then What Happens?

Whenever any class (like a Controller or another Service) **needs a service**, it **asks the DI manager**, like:

> ‚ÄúHey, I need `UserService`!‚Äù

And the manager replies:

> ‚ÄúHere you go! I already have that instance ready. Use it.‚Äù

---

### ‚úÖ Why is This Good?

- ‚úÖ No duplicate objects ‚Äî only one instance is created (singleton by default)
- ‚úÖ Faster development ‚Äî NestJS handles the object creation
- ‚úÖ Clean code ‚Äî no more `new SomeService()` inside your classes
- ‚úÖ Easier testing ‚Äî you can replace the real object with a fake one during testing

---

### üîÅ Example in NestJS

```ts
@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  findAll() {
    return ['John', 'Jane'];
  }
}
```

```ts
@Controller('users')
export class UserController {
  constructor(private userService: UserService) {} // DI manager gives this
}
```

- You didn‚Äôt write `new UserService()`
- NestJS created the instance when starting the app
- Then it **automatically gave** it to the controller

---

---

## üè∑Ô∏è What is a Decorator in TypeScript / NestJS?

A **decorator** is a special **function that adds extra behavior or information** to classes, methods, properties, or parameters.

In NestJS, decorators are used to **define routes, inject services, bind metadata, and control behavior** ‚Äî all in a clean, readable way.

---

### üß† Think of It Like a Tag or Label

You place a **`@decorator`** above something (like a class or method), and that "tag" tells NestJS to treat it in a special way.

---

### üîß Common Decorators in NestJS:

| Decorator       | Use Case                                       |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `@Controller()`  | Marks a class as a controller (handles routes) |
| `@Get()`         | Maps a method to a GET HTTP request            |
| `@Post()`        | Maps a method to a POST HTTP request           |
| `@Injectable()`  | Marks a class as a service that can be injected |
| `@Param()`       | Gets a route parameter from the URL            |
| `@Body()`        | Gets the body of a POST request                |
| `@Query()`       | Gets query parameters from the URL             |

---

### üîÅ Example:

```ts
@Controller('users')
export class UserController {
  constructor(private userService: UserService) {}

  @Get()
  getUsers() {
    return this.userService.findAll();
  }

  @Post()
  createUser(@Body() userData: CreateUserDto) {
    return this.userService.create(userData);
  }
}
```

Quick, beginner-friendly explanations of key NestJS concepts for fast learners.

## Body
Data sent in the HTTP request's payload (e.g., JSON in POST). Use `@Body()` to access it.  
**Example**:  
```typescript
@Post() create(@Body() data: any) { return data; }
```

## Query
Key-value pairs in the URL after `?` (e.g., `?name=John`). Use `@Query()` to extract them.  
**Example**:  
```typescript
@Get() find(@Query('name') name: string) { return name; }
```

## Param
Dynamic URL path parts (e.g., `/users/:id`). Use `@Param()` to capture them.  
**Example**:  
```typescript
@Get(':id') getById(@Param('id') id: string) { return id; }
```

## Request
The full HTTP request object (headers, body, etc.). Use `@Req()`, but prefer specific decorators.  
**Example**:  
```typescript
@Get() getRequest(@Req() req) { return req.headers; }
```

## Response
The HTTP response object. Use `@Res()` for manual control, but NestJS handles it automatically.  
**Example**:  
```typescript
@Get() send(@Res() res) { res.status(200).send('Hello'); }
```

## Handlers
Controller methods handling HTTP requests. Use decorators like `@Get()`, `@Post()`.  
**Example**:  
```typescript
@Get('hello') getHello() { return 'Hello World'; }
```

## Status Code
Numeric code for response status (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found). Override with `@HttpCode()`.  
**Example**:  
```typescript
@Post() @HttpCode(201) create() { return 'Created'; }
```
[Learn about status code:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status)  

## DTO (Data Transfer Object)
TypeScript class defining data shape for validation. Use with `class-validator`.  
**Example**:  
```typescript
class CreateUserDto {
  @IsString() name: string;
  @IsInt() age: number;
}
@Post() create(@Body() dto: CreateUserDto) { return dto; }
```

## What is ORM?

ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) acts as a translator between the objects in your code and the tables in your database. Instead of writing raw SQL, you interact with your database using object-oriented methods.

## TypeORM in NestJS

TypeORM is a powerful ORM specifically for TypeScript and JavaScript, and `@nestjs/typeorm` provides seamless integration within the NestJS framework.

**Key benefits of using `@nestjs/typeorm`:**

* **Simplified Database Interaction:** Define database tables as TypeScript classes (entities).
* **Easy Data Access:** Use TypeORM repositories to perform database operations (read, write, update, delete) without writing SQL.
* **NestJS Integration:** `@nestjs/typeorm` handles database connection management and makes it easy to inject repositories into your NestJS services.

In short, TypeORM in NestJS streamlines database interactions in your backend applications, making your code cleaner and more maintainable.


## üîÅ CRUD Operations with PostgreSQL

CRUD stands for:

- **C** ‚Üí Create (Add new data)
- **R** ‚Üí Read (Get data)
- **U** ‚Üí Update (Change data)
- **D** ‚Üí Delete (Remove data)

Here is how CRUD looks with a PostgreSQL database:

```
[ Client (frontend/app) ]
        |
        | HTTP Request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
        v
[ NestJS REST API (Controller + Service) ]
        |
        | SQL Query
        v
[ PostgreSQL Database ]
```

Example:

| Method | Route        | Action             |
|--------|--------------|--------------------|
| GET    | /users       | Get all users      |
| POST   | /users       | Create a new user  |
| PUT    | /users/:id   | Update a user      |
| DELETE | /users/:id   | Delete a user      |

This guide will walk you through setting up PostgreSQL on Windows, creating a database, and configuring your `.env` file for your NestJS project.

## Step 1: Install PostgreSQL on Windows

1.  **Navigate to the PostgreSQL Downloads page:** Go to the official PostgreSQL website ([https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)).
2.  **Download the Installer:** Click on the link for the latest stable version of PostgreSQL for Windows. You'll likely be directed to the EnterpriseDB (EDB) website, which provides the installer. Download the appropriate installer for your system architecture (usually x64).
3.  **Run the Installer:** Once the download is complete, double-click the `.exe` file to start the PostgreSQL Setup Wizard.
4.  **Follow the Setup Wizard:**
    * Click "Next" on the welcome screen.
    * Choose an installation directory (the default is usually fine) and click "Next".
    * Select the components to install. At a minimum, ensure that "PostgreSQL Server," "pgAdmin 4," "Stack Builder," and "Command Line Tools" are selected. Click "Next".
    * Choose a data directory (the default is usually fine) and click "Next".
    * **Set the Password for the `postgres` User:** This is a crucial step. Enter a strong password for the default PostgreSQL superuser (`postgres`). Remember this password! Click "Next".
    * Choose a port number for the PostgreSQL server (the default is `5432`). Click "Next".
    * Select the default locale (usually "Default locale") and click "Next".
    * Review the pre-installation summary and click "Next" to begin the installation.
5.  **Wait for Installation:** The installation process may take a few minutes.
6.  **Stack Builder (Optional):** After the main installation, the Setup Wizard might ask if you want to launch Stack Builder. Stack Builder can help you install additional PostgreSQL tools and drivers. You can choose to do this now or later. For basic NestJS development, you might not need to install anything through Stack Builder immediately.
7.  **Finish:** Click "Finish" to close the Setup Wizard.

## Step 2: Create a Database

You can create a database using either the command line tools or the pgAdmin graphical interface.

**Method 1: Using Command Line Tools (psql)**

1.  **Open Command Prompt:** Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
2.  **Connect to PostgreSQL:** Type the following command and press Enter:
    ```bash
    psql -U postgres
    ```
    You will be prompted for the password you set during installation for the `postgres` user. Enter it and press Enter.
3.  **Create the Database:** Once connected to the `postgres` prompt (`postgres=#`), use the following command to create your database (replace `your_database_name` with your desired name, e.g., `study_user_app`):
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
    ```
    For your project, you would use:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE study_user_app;
    ```
4.  **Exit psql:** Type `\q` and press Enter to exit the PostgreSQL command line.

**Method 2: Using pgAdmin**

1.  **Open pgAdmin 4:** Search for "pgAdmin 4" in the Windows Start Menu and open the application.
2.  **Connect to Your Server:** In the "Servers" panel on the left, you should see your PostgreSQL server listed (usually under "PostgreSQL 1x"). If it's not connected, right-click on the server and choose "Connect Server...". Enter the password for the `postgres` user if prompted.
3.  **Create a New Database:**
    * Right-click on the "Databases" node under your server.
    * Select "Create" -> "Database...".
    * In the "New Database" dialog, enter the desired database name in the "Database" field (e.g., `study_user_app`).
    * You can leave the other settings as default for now.
    * Click "Save".

## Step 3: Create a `.env` File

In the root directory of your NestJS project, create a new file named `.env`. This file will store your environment variables, including your database connection details and the port your application will run on.

Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add the following information, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:

```dotenv
DB_TYPE=postgres
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=study_user_app
DB_PASSWORD=8520
DB_DATABASE=study_user_app

PORT=3001
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Module for Users

```bash
nest generate module users
nest generate controller users
nest generate service users
```

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Setup TypeORM Entity for Users

Create a `user.entity.ts` file with fields like name, email, etc.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Complete CRUD Functionality

In `users.service.ts` and `users.controller.ts`, write the logic to:

- Create User
- Get All Users
- Get User by ID
- Update User
- Delete User

---

### ‚úÖ Run the API

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Visit: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
